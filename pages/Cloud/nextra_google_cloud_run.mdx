# Blog setup - Nextra and Google Cloud

In the past, I set up a blog using Github Pages. The only requirement was to learn Ruby and Rails because the Github Page blog was based on Jekyll.

Given the prevalence of React in the community, I discovered that nextra is a great alternative to Jekyll for developers with a stronger React background, especially for documentation and blogging purposes.

The next consideration was how to build and host the project. After some research, I came across a solution involving Google Build, Google Cloud Run, and Github webhooks. By utilizing these tools, I could automate the entire build, deployment, and hosting workflow. Now, whenever I make a commit to Github, all the necessary steps are performed automatically. Within a few minutes, the latest changes are live on the Internet.
